# AI Collaboration Reflection

**Student Name:** [Christopher Urban]

## What worked well with AI

**How your prompting improved:**

``` text
[I found that asking specific questions, and even telling the AI what you want the answer to contain helped significantly. For example, asking not only what colors would work for a scheme, but to answer it with color codes and to consider accessibility when choosing.]
```

**AI's best contributions:**

``` text
[It was a great technical guide, explaining specific questions I had and giving me copius details on what I asked about. This will undoubtedly be a great tool for confirming my work and getting a quick second opinion on decisions for my work.]
```

## Learning from limitations

**Advice for other students:**

``` text
[Be specific if you want short answers, or ask for them. Otherwise the AI will seemingly pull out all the stops and practically show you a 20 step process for every little detail of the answer. In its own way, that is useful, but not for every question you ask.]
```

## Ready for implementation?

**How will you use AI in the main Poetry project?**

``` text
[I will likely use the AI the same way I have been this whole time. If I get stuck and need quick help I will ask the AI. If I need a second opinion on something I will ask them. I might even ask the AI to give me the base coding layout to save time so my effort can be put more towards polishing the final result.]
```

**Most important lesson learned:**

``` text
[AI has gotten better at explaining itself and even siting sources since I last used it. This will be pivotal for completing this and other coding projects. I can use this as a quick way of gathering sources and information quickly for the purpose of expediting my work speed.]
```
